This project is developed primarily by **Andrew Peterson** and **Alireza Khorshidi** in the Brown University School of Engineering. Specific credits:

* Andrew Peterson: lead, PI, many modules
* Alireza Khorshidi: many modules, Zernike descriptor
* Zack Ulissi: tensorflow version of neural network
* Muammar El Khatib: general contributions


We are also indebted to Nongnuch Artrith (MIT) and Pedro Felzenszwalb (Brown) for inspiration and technical discussion.
